#SimplyCrypto

SimplyCrypto is a comprehensive app that allows users to view Cryptocurrency price trends, for multiple currencies over 
multiple devices. Using the CryptoCompare API, we are able to display relevant information to the user through a NSURLSrtream. 
Utilizing this data, we are able to display graphs to the user, showing trends. In addition, we store user preferences inside 
of firebase, allowing them to customize which currencies they are following.

Additionally, we allow the user to select a specific time frame from the various graphs they are presented with, within 
the application. The user is able to view the graph over a day, week, month, and year. Moreover, allow the user to calculate 
their personal gains/losses through inputting the amount of currency they purchased as well as the value of the currency at 
the time of purchase.
